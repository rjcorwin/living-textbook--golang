# Living Textbook for RJ Corwin to study Golang

In this repository, RJ will ask an AI Agent to create a curriculum in a `curriculum.md` file. Then RJ will ask the AI Agent to zoom in on a topic, creating the content on the fly in a new file, and RJ's conversation with the AI will be incorporated into the text by the AI Agent and RJ in a collaborative fashion.

## Notes about RJ
1. He comes from a Javascript/Typescript background. When explaining concepts in Golang, if you can tie it back to TS/JS please do, wether it's a difference or similarity. 

## Notes for the AI Agent
1. When creating a page on a topic, always create a new markdown file and link to that file from the curriculum file.
2. When RJ has insights into the content, make sure to incorporate those into the content. Make sure to capture those Aha moments. 
3. When RJ asks to create an example from the docs, create a folder named similar to the doc the example lives in followed by some unique name referencing the example.
